/**
 * Renders timed lyrics, wiping through the active line word by word when the
 * source carries word timings.
 *
 * The wipe is driven by CSS, not by JavaScript. Playback position only arrives
 * every 500ms — far too coarse for words that last 200-400ms — so instead of
 * re-rendering at 60fps, each word in the active line is given a CSS animation
 * whose `animation-delay` is its offset from a captured anchor. A negative
 * delay starts an animation part-way through, so a word already half-sung
 * renders half-wiped immediately, and the compositor animates the rest for
 * free. Re-renders keep producing identical delay values while the anchor
 * holds, so React never touches the DOM and the animation is never restarted.
