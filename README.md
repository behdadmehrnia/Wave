## Highlights

| | |
|---|---|
| 🎧 **Offline-first** | Your library is local files plus a SQLite index. No account, no server, no telemetry. |
| ⚡ **Native audio** | Rodio + Symphonia + CPAL on desktop, Media3 ExoPlayer on Android. No web audio stack. |
| 🔍 **Three-tier search** | Filters the current view, then the whole library (lyrics included), then — only if you ask — the internet. |
| 🎚️ **Real DSP** | 10-band biquad equalizer, crossfade, gapless playback, and loudness normalization. |
| 📝 **Synced lyrics** | Auto-fetched from LRCLIB, highlighted line by line, importable and exportable. |
| 🌐 **Free catalogs** | Stream or download full-length tracks from Internet Archive and Jamendo. Off by default. |
| 📱 **One codebase** | Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android — desktop and touch layouts from the same UI. |
| 🪶 **Portable** | A single native binary; no Electron, no heavy runtime. |

## Features

### Home & discovery

The home screen is built from your own listening history — a featured track based
on what you last played, a "Mix for you" row of neighbors from songs you finish,
album shelves, and suggested artists similar to the ones you actually listen to.

<img src="docs/screenshots/desktop-home.png" alt="Home screen with featured track, mix and album shelves" width="100%">

### Library, albums & artists

Point Wave at a folder and it scans, extracts tags, embeds cover art, and indexes
everything into SQLite. The library view is virtualized, sortable, and resizable,
with inline favorite toggles and a right-click menu for **Play Next**, **Add to
Queue**, **Add to Playlist**, **Go to Album**, and **Go to Artist**.

Supported formats: `aac`, `aiff`, `alac`, `caf`, `flac`, `m4a`, `m4b`, `m4p`,
`mka`, `mkv`, `mp1`, `mp2`, `mp3`, `mp4`, `oga`, `ogg`, `opus`, `wav`, `wave`,
`weba`.

<img src="docs/screenshots/desktop-library.png" alt="Library track list" width="100%">

Album and artist pages are generated from your tags — full-resolution cover,
tracklist, and a per-artist discography you can jump into from any track.

<img src="docs/screenshots/desktop-album.png" alt="Album page" width="100%">

### Three-tier search

Search widens only as far as it has to, and never touches the network on its own:

1. **Current view** — instant filter over whatever list you are looking at.
2. **Your library** — realtime SQLite search across title, artist, album,
   filename, **and lyrics**, with badges showing which field matched and a
   snippet of the matching lyric line.
3. **The internet** — an explicit button, never automatic. Off entirely unless
   you enable **Search outside sources** in Settings.

<img src="docs/screenshots/desktop-search.png" alt="Library search with matched-field badges and lyric snippets" width="100%">

Tier 3 queries Internet Archive, Jamendo, and Deezer concurrently and groups the
results by provider with their licence line. Full-length audio can be streamed or
saved to your library; Deezer only exposes 30-second previews, so those play but
are never written to disk. A provider that fails degrades to an "unavailable"
section instead of breaking the search.

<img src="docs/screenshots/desktop-sources.png" alt="Remote source results grouped by provider" width="100%">

### Queue & playback

An in-memory queue independent of your playlists: reorder by drag, remove
individual entries, queue a track next, shuffle, and repeat off / one / all.
Previous rewinds the current track if you are more than three seconds in.

<img src="docs/screenshots/desktop-queue.png" alt="Queue panel" width="100%">

### Lyrics

Lyrics are fetched automatically from [LRCLIB](https://lrclib.net) when a song
starts (toggleable), stored with the track, and highlighted line by line in sync
with playback. You can also import your own `.lrc` files, export everything as a
backup, and restore a lyrics backup into matching library tracks later.

<img src="docs/screenshots/desktop-lyrics.png" alt="Synced lyrics panel" width="100%">

### Audio engine & DSP

- **10-band graphic equalizer** (31 Hz – 16 kHz) built from real biquad peaking
  filters, with presets and ±12 dB per band, applied live without a gap.
- **Crossfade** up to 8 seconds between tracks.
- **Gapless playback** for continuous albums.
- **Volume normalization** that pulls quiet and loud tracks toward the median
  loudness of your queue without clipping.
- **Audio output device switching** at runtime.

<img src="docs/screenshots/desktop-equalizer.png" alt="Equalizer, crossfade and gapless controls" width="100%">

### Playlists, favorites & folder sync

Create, rename, delete, import, and export playlists (`m3u` and `json`).
**Favorites** and **All Local Files** are permanent seeded playlists. Any playlist
can be *linked to a folder* — Wave then re-scans that folder on demand and keeps
the playlist in step with what is actually on disk.

<img src="docs/screenshots/desktop-settings.png" alt="Settings — playlists, lyrics and music sources" width="100%">

### Listening stats

Total listening time, play counts, and ranked top songs, artists, albums, and
genres — computed locally from your own playback history.

<img src="docs/screenshots/desktop-stats.png" alt="Listening statistics" width="100%">

### Desktop & OS integration

- **System tray / menu bar** icon with transport controls and a playlist submenu.
- **OS media controls** — the platform's own now-playing widget, media keys, and
  lock-screen artwork stay in sync.
- **Close-to-tray** — choose whether the close button quits Wave or hides it.
- **Single instance** — a second launch hands off to the running app instead of
  starting a competing audio engine.

### Command line

The same binary runs headless. `wave --help` exposes subcommands for `tracks`,
`playlists`, `playback`, `queue`, `devices`, `favorite`, `metadata`, `dsp`, and
`stats`, backed by a background playback daemon with its own tray icon and a
localhost control socket.

```bash
wave tracks import ~/Music          # scan files or folders into the library
wave tracks list                    # list every track
wave playlists list                 # list playlists with their IDs
wave playlists export <id> m3u out.m3u
wave playback start <playlist-id>   # play through the daemon
wave playback status
wave stats artists --limit 10       # top artists by listen time
```

## Android

Android is a first-class target, not a resized desktop build. The Rust core still
owns the library and the queue, but decoding and output go through **Media3
ExoPlayer** over JNI so `content://` URIs from the Storage Access Framework play
directly — no copying your music into app storage.

- Touch layout with a drawer, a bottom mini-player, and a full **Now Playing**
  sheet you can drag to dismiss.
- **SAF folder picker** and scanning — grant a folder once, keep your files where
  they are.
- **Media session** bridge: notification controls, lock screen, Bluetooth, and
  Android Auto-style transport events.
- Android back button is trapped so it closes panels and sheets before leaving.
- Built for `arm64-v8a` and `armeabi-v7a`, `minSdkVersion 24`.

### Backend layout notes

- The backend lives in `src-tauri/`; `tauri.conf.json` is inside that directory, not at the repository root.
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` is the GUI/backend composition root where state and Tauri commands are registered.
- `src-tauri/src/main.rs` selects between GUI mode, CLI mode, and the playback daemon at startup.
- `src/utils/player.ts` is the frontend-facing wrapper around the backend command surface.
- Detailed backend API docs live in [`docs/backend/README.md`](docs/backend/README.md).
- Android ExoPlayer + SAF details: [`docs/backend/android.md`](docs/backend/android.md).
- Remote sourcing (providers, streaming cache, downloads): [`docs/backend/sources.md`](docs/backend/sources.md).
- Equalizer and filter math: [`docs/backend/dsp.md`](docs/backend/dsp.md).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (LTS)
- **Rust** and **Cargo**
- **Git**

Verify:

```bash
node -v && rustc --version && cargo --version
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run in development

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

This starts the frontend and the native backend together. Opening the plain Vite
URL in a browser will not work — the UI needs the Tauri backend behind it.

### Build for production

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

Portable binaries are produced for your platform.

### Android

```bash
npm run android:init     # once, to generate the Gradle project
npm run android:dev      # run on a connected device or emulator
npm run android:build    # produce an APK / AAB
```

Requires the Android SDK + NDK and the `aarch64-linux-android` /
`armv7-linux-androideabi` Rust targets.

### Optional: remote sources

Wave works fully offline. Searching the internet for music is opt-in — toggle
**Search outside sources** in Settings.

Deezer and Internet Archive need no setup. Jamendo needs a free client ID from
[developer.jamendo.com](https://developer.jamendo.com), entered in Settings.

Deezer's API only serves 30-second previews; previews play but are never saved to
your library. Full-length audio comes from Internet Archive and Jamendo.

## Design goals

- **Fast startup**
- **Low memory usage**
- **Clean architecture**
- **No unnecessary dependencies**
- **Long-term maintainability**
